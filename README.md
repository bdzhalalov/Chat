# Chat

This is a simple chat created with Django and Channels 

## Installation

All you need is to clone this repository to your device and run terminal command `docker-compose up -d --build`

( The Docker on your device is required!)

And then the docker will build project image with downloading all of dependencies from `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml`

Don't forget to set up environment variables for correct service work.
